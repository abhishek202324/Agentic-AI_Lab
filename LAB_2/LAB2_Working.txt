Working of the Text Splitting Code (5 Levels of Text Splitting)
1. Introduction
The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate text splitting techniques used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and LLM-based applications such as:
* Document Question Answering

* Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

* Semantic Search

* Chatbots on PDFs / documents

Large Language Models cannot process very large documents at once due to token limits.
Therefore, text splitting is used to divide large text into smaller, meaningful chunks.

2. Why Text Splitting is Required
Text splitting helps to:
   * Reduce token overflow

   * Preserve semantic meaning

   * Improve retrieval accuracy

   * Enable efficient embeddings and vector search

Without proper splitting:
      * Context is lost

      * Answers become inaccurate

      * LLM responses degrade

3. Libraries Used
The notebook typically uses:
         * langchain – for text splitters

         * re – for regex-based splitting

         * os – for file handling

         * PyPDFLoader / TextLoader – for loading documents

         * RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter – for intelligent chunking

These libraries help in handling unstructured text efficiently.

4. Input Data
The input can be:
            * Plain text files (.txt)

            * PDF documents

            * Web content

            * Multi-modal text (text extracted from images or PDFs)

The text is first loaded completely into memory before splitting.

5. Level 1: Character-Based Text Splitting
Working
At this level, text is split purely based on fixed character length.
Example:
               * Chunk size = 500 characters

               * Overlap = 50 characters

How it works
                  * The text is read sequentially

                  * Every 500 characters form one chunk

                  * Last 50 characters overlap with the next chunk

Advantage
                     * Simple and fast

Disadvantage
                        * May break sentences or paragraphs

                        * Context loss can occur

6. Level 2: Word-Based Text Splitting
Working
Text is split based on number of words instead of characters.
How it works
                           * Text is tokenized into words

                           * Fixed number of words per chunk

                           * Optional overlap between chunks

Advantage
                              * Better than character splitting

                              * Preserves word boundaries

Disadvantage
                                 * Still may break sentences

                                 * Does not understand semantics

7. Level 3: Sentence-Based Text Splitting
Working
This method splits text using sentence boundaries.
How it works
                                    * Uses punctuation such as ., ?, !

                                    * Each chunk contains complete sentences

                                    * Chunk size is controlled by sentence count

Advantage
                                       * Maintains sentence integrity

                                       * Improves readability

Disadvantage
                                          * Long sentences may exceed token limits

                                          * Uneven chunk sizes

________________


8. Level 4: Recursive Text Splitting (Recommended)
Working
Recursive splitting is the most practical and intelligent approach.
How it works
The splitter tries to break text using this priority order:
                                             1. Paragraphs (\n\n)

                                             2. Sentences (.)

                                             3. Words

                                             4. Characters (last resort)

If a chunk exceeds the size limit, it recursively applies the next level.
Advantage
                                                * Preserves semantic structure

                                                * Produces balanced chunks

                                                * Ideal for LLM pipelines

Disadvantage
                                                   * Slightly computationally expensive

9. Level 5: Semantic / Multi-Modal Text Splitting
Working
This level focuses on meaning-aware splitting, often used with:
                                                      * Embeddings

                                                      * Images + text

                                                      * Headings and sections

How it works
                                                         * Text is split based on logical sections

                                                         * Headings, titles, and context are preserved

                                                         * Can combine OCR text from images with document text

Advantage
                                                            * Best semantic preservation

                                                            * High retrieval accuracy

Disadvantage
                                                               * Requires more processing

                                                               * Often combined with vector databases

10. Chunk Overlap Mechanism
Purpose
Chunk overlap ensures that:
                                                                  * Important context is not lost

                                                                  * Boundary information is preserved

Example
If overlap = 50 tokens:
                                                                     * Last 50 tokens of previous chunk appear in next chunk

This improves answer quality in RAG systems.

11. Output of the Code
The final output of the notebook is:
                                                                        * A list of text chunks

                                                                        * Each chunk has:

                                                                           * Content

                                                                           * Chunk index

                                                                           * Metadata (source, page number, etc.)

These chunks are later used for:
                                                                              * Embedding generation

                                                                              * Vector storage

                                                                              * LLM querying

                                                                                 * Legal document analysis

                                                                                 * Academic research assistants

                                                                                 * Enterprise search engines

                                                                                 * AI tutors and note summarization

13. Conclusion
This notebook demonstrates five progressive levels of text splitting, starting from basic character splitting to advanced semantic-aware splitting.
Proper text splitting:
                                                                                    * Improves LLM performance

                                                                                    * Preserves context

                                                                                    * Enables scalable document intelligence

It is a core preprocessing step in all modern LLM-based systems.
